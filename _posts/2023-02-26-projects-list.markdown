### 1. Machine Learning and Data Analyses
- **Moral Decisions in Delegation to AI (10/2021-12/2022): ([Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FMxynocStYkhfLF4EXrOq1K7T6hO8sKP/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=107842578935822475487&rtpof=true&sd=true) |  [Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TENWmare53ZXD8am1016fz3WB8tXWwBL/view))**:  
I investigated the impact of delegating decision-making to an algorithm using different training methods on honesty in behavioral experiments conducted online using oTree, Python, Django, and JavaScript.


- **EEG-based assessment of perceived quality of images (06/2019-10/2019): ([Master's Thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YolojEe8JKxKA5a6IvFjQU07SUHb3Lql/view?usp=share_link) | [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9191277) | [Presentation <large file ~200MB>](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VxHsJNcVn5O4p5spFxMK_UTnzXmIhqtB/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=107842578935822475487&rtpof=true&sd=true))**:  
I conducted a masterâ€™s thesis project involving the analysis of EEG neural data using Spatio-Spectral Decomposition and Reliable Component Analysis to assess the visual perceptual quality of complex natural images using Python, LabStreamingLayer, Brainvision EEG recordings, sklearn, and TensorFlow. My results demonstrate that EEG can be used to objectively evaluate image quality.


- **Head Movement Onset Prediction in VR (10/2018-01/2019): ([Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hLdpM22mEQb3oi9ablVzOg3IGclvuKFY/view?usp=share_link) | [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gNRTWcVZXvHeQT0wrk-9CDWx553jC47I/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=107842578935822475487&rtpof=true&sd=true))**:  
I applied machine learning regression methods using neural networks and LSTM on EMG data to predict head movement onset and direction for VR applications using MNE-python, sklearn, and TensorFlow.


- **Rhythm Perception in Auditory Stimuli (10/2017-02/2018):([Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1F-0spGynMJdu1BxBd73nu9zXw7X4TqgW/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=107842578935822475487&rtpof=true&sd=true) | [Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JTA781pjn9V2n0pj8KNIAeWdU7cBHbwR/view?usp=share_link))**:  
I pre-processed EEG signals with ERP analysis of rhythm perception in recorded EEG signals using EEG neural data and audio data. 


### 2. Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience
- **Blurry Faces and Empathy in Video Communication (10/2021-12/2022)**:  
I investigated the effect of ignoring emotional cues in video communication on empathy in social interactions using online experiments with React, Django, JavaScript, CSS, Docker, Kubernetes, Nginx, Python, and R.


- **Top-down vs. bottom-up guidance of eye movements (04/2018-08/2018): ([Poster](https://cdn.technologynetworks.com/ep/pdfs/top-down-vs-bottom-up-guidance-of-eye-movements-in-real-world-scene-search.pdf))**:  
We analyzed eye tracking data in scene search tasks and compared the roles of high-level features (context prior maps) and low-level features (saliency maps) in guiding the saccades using eye tracking data, saliency maps, and context priori maps of test images. Our findings suggest that both high-level and low-level features play a role in guiding eye movements during scene search tasks.


### 3. Neuroscience and Experimental Psychology
- **Eye tracking in the wild for face detection (01/2021-04/2021): ([Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bWQPTMviIm45v2MOvECgiW2vxhuRvPoP/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=107842578935822475487&rtpof=true&sd=true))**:  
I conducted synchronization of eye tracking and EEG recordings and extracted face detection signals using Python, LabStreamingLayer, Eye tracking (PupilLabs), and Video processing. My work demonstrates a method for synchronizing eye tracking and EEG data and extracting relevant signals for further analysis.


- **Evolution of trust under ambiguity (09/2020-12/2020) ([Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/170F9HqoQICqcRIUXYs8acMGi_15fnrDJ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107842578935822475487&rtpof=true&sd=true))**:  
I designed and implemented an experimental pipeline aimed at examining the impact of introducing ambiguity to the environment on the development of trust in the classical trust game. Using JavaScript and jsPsych.


- **Awareness of intentions in movement preparation (02/2018-06/2018): ([Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P019AJvn7tq7d-S5zMBlaU_OsVsmzwJv/view?usp=share_link))**:  
I designed and conducted an EEG experiment that involved recording over 10 participants. I updated the experiment scripts using BBCI toolbox in Matlab and Pyff in Python to analyze the collected data. The project aimed to investigate awareness of intentions in movement preparation through EEG signals.


### 4. Embedded Systems and Signal Processing
- **Designing and Implementation of a Spectrum Analyzer (10/2014-05/2015)**:  
Designed and implemented a Spectrum Analyser on FPGA for a Bachelor's thesis project.
